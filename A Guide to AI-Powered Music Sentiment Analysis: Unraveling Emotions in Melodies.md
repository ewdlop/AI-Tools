It sounds like you're interested in AI-based music audio sentiment analysis. This is a field where artificial intelligence is used to analyze audio tracks to determine the sentiment or emotions conveyed in the music. Such technology can have various applications, including:

Music Recommendation Systems: By understanding the emotional content of songs, recommendation systems can offer more personalized playlists to listeners based on their mood.

Content Categorization: Music streaming platforms can use sentiment analysis to categorize songs into different mood-based playlists, like "relaxing," "energetic," "sad," etc.

Music Therapy: In therapeutic settings, understanding the emotional impact of music can help in selecting tracks that are beneficial for patients' emotional states.

Market Analysis: Music producers and labels can use sentiment analysis to understand current trends and preferences in music.

Academic Research: Researchers in musicology and psychology might use such tools to study the relationship between music and emotions.

The process typically involves several steps:

Feature Extraction: The AI analyzes various features of the audio, like tempo, pitch, rhythm, harmony, and timbre.

Machine Learning Models: These features are then fed into machine learning models that have been trained to recognize patterns associated with different emotions.

Sentiment Classification: The model classifies the music into different sentiment categories, such as happy, sad, angry, relaxed, etc.

Output Generation: Finally, the system outputs the analysis, which might include the identified sentiment and the confidence level of the prediction.

Keep in mind that the perception of emotion in music can be highly subjective and influenced by cultural and personal factors, so while AI can provide insights, it may not always align perfectly with every individual listener's experience.
